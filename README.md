# Get Started

Time to start working with unit tests in Java.

This repository contains an example of the repository from assignment 2 in the OOP course. 
Write tests to ensure that the farm animals behave the way they are supposed to. 

This repository also contains the code examples from our demonstration. Use them as a guideline for how to write tests.

## Steps:
- clone this repo
- set up junit
	- write actual tests (~30mins)
	- evaluation (who did what, what did they find, what is a good test...)
	
- show mocking if interested and we have time (if we have classes, it should be fairly easy to add)
