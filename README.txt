tasks to do:

- come up with example (probably addition with different test scenarios)
- come up with exercise (probably not very trivial, with some bugs that we test here but release only the source code for them (at first)
	- clone git repo
	- set up junit
	- write actual tests (~30mins)
	- evaluation (who did what, what did they find, what is a good test...)
	
- show mocking if interested and we have time (if we have classes, it should be fairly easy to add)
